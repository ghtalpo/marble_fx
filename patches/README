This patch removes the ACM interface from the USB core and leaves only the
HID part.

Note: after deploying this, the leonardo board can no longer be updated
directly from the Arduino IDE. After initiating the upload, you need to
press the reset button on the board to put the bootloader into flash-mode.

This has only been tested with marble_fx.ino, use at your own risk!
